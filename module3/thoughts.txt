Observations:
(1) The GPU version is significantly faster than the CPU version for this large array size (n in the millions), especially in the no-branch case.
(2) Adding conditional branching increases GPU runtime (branch version slower than no-branch), consistent with warp divergence. Threads within the same warp may take different paths and serialize execution.
(3) The CPU timing changes less dramatically with branching, since CPUs use different mechanisms (branch prediction, out-of-order execution) than SIMT warps.

Notes on configuration:
(1) Increasing total threads from 512 to 1024 reduced GPU time in these runs.
(2) Changing block size from 256 to 128 produced a smaller performance change, but still affected GPU runtime.
