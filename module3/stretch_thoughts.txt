Good qualities: This submission demonstrates a GPU kernel and a CPU-based method executing the same (or similar) algorithm and it includes a mechanism to use command line arguments to vary the number of threads and the block size (via argc/argv). It also attempts a performance comparison by timing both the GPU kernel and the CPU method.
Issues: If the surrounding script only executes main() once, the performance comparison is weak because a single run is noisy and not representative (no warm-up and no repeated runs/averaging). In addition, the GPU timing as written can be misleading because timing around a kernel launch without CUDA event timing and/or an explicit synchronize risks measuring mostly launch overhead rather than actual kernel execution. Finally, there is no clear correctness check comparing CPU vs GPU outputs, so it’s possible to report timings even if results are wrong.
